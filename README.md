#DonorsSelect

#The Problem
DonorsChoose has thousands of interesting projects. However the search for projects is cumbersome and clunky for potential donors. DonorsChoose's project finder does not optimize the searching process and is leaving money on the table.

#The Solution
DonorsSelect reimagines the DonorsChoose project discovery experience in a single-page app. Donors can filter projects by state, subject, and grade. At each step of the filtration process, a recommended project is available. Users can also browse projects based on their filter criteria. The simplicity and straighforwardness of DonorsSelect is a winning choice for DonorsChoose and will increase participation and donations.
